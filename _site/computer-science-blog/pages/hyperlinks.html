		<h2>Hyperlinks</h2>
		<p>
			A hyperlink is simply a link on the web to another resource. It uses a special kind of command that jumps you to different content in your web browser - usually to another page.Â 
			<br>
			Hyperlinks are often denoted by blue underlined text or content which turns the cursor into a pointing hand when hovered over; however, they can be styled however the web designer wishes; their appearances do not change their function.
			<br>
			Website owners reserve the right not to be hyperlinked without permission.
			<br>
			Hyperlinks are defined in HTML as follows:
			<code>&lt;a href="LINK GOES HERE"&gt;TEXT GOES HERE&lt;/a&gt;</code>
